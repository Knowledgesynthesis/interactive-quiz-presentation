The coefficient of determination expresses the percentage of the variability in the outcome factor that is explained by the predictor factor. In this question, the correlation coefficient is (-0.8); therefore, (-0.8)*(-0.8) = 0.64 (64%) Of variability in plasma homocysteine level is explained by folic acid intake.</h3>
